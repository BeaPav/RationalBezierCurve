# RationalBezierCurve


The Rational Bezier Curve is an enhanced version of the Bezier curve used in computer graphics and design. 
It incorporates weights for control points, allowing more precise curve shaping. The curve is computed using
control point coordinates and weights, with the De Casteljau algorithm enabling its construction. This results
in smoother and adjustable curves that find applications in creating intricate shapes, animations, and precise
industrial designs.
